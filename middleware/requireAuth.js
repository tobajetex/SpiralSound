Challenge:
1. Create middleware that checks if the session has a userId attached to it. 
   
   - If it doesn’t, log to the console that access has been blocked, and end the response with a 401 and this json: { error: 'Unauthorized' }
   - If the session does have a userId, pass control on to the next middleware. 
   - Place the middleware to protect our cart routes.

You will need to write code both here and wherever you choose to place the middleware.
